Hi, I’m Hamza Benkhay, I am a software engineer at Geocene.
I build and ship full-stack applications and data pipelines that process millions of entries daily and house billions of metrics.
I use Python/Postgres with Django/Flask to design applications able to store and query large amounts of time series data such as collecting metrics
from a massive fleet of IoT devices.
